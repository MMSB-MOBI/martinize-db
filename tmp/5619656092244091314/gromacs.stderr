GROMACS reminds you: "I went to Venice and looked at the paintings of Canaletto to understand how he presented perspective, and it turned out it was an exponential law. If I had published this, maybe there would be a Karplus law in art theory as well as the Karplus equation in NMR" (Martin Karplus, Nobel lecture 2013)
